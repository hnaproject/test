["index.html", "Comparative Analysis of Social Media and Stock Data 1 Introduction 1.1 Hypothesis", " Comparative Analysis of Social Media and Stock Data 1 Introduction Over the past few weeks, we collected various forms of Twitter and stock performance data for a handful of technology companies. More specifically, we collected each company’s daily tweets directed at their respective support pages and their end-of-day stock price. Our data collection occurred over a span of 21 days, through the dates of 6/30/20 and 7/20/20. In our report, we utilized visualizations to show clear connections between social media and stock metrics, and ultimately showing relationships as a collective group. 1.1 Hypothesis Before collecting and visualizing any data, in June, we predicted that we would see a negative correlation between each individual company’s stock performance and their respective Twitter support handle’s daily activity. We believe that this hypothesis represents that the better companies operate, with fewer errors in their product delivery, the happier and less active on social media support pages their customers will be. This heightened level of operational success and customer satisfaction or lack thereof is what we believe to directly affect each company’s stock price. install.packages ## function (...) ## .rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...) ## &lt;environment: 0x000002297da7b2c8&gt; library(httpuv) library(rtweet) library(dplyr) library(lubridate) library(ggplot2) library(quantmod) if (!requireNamespace(&quot;httpuv&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) { install.packages(&quot;httpuv&quot;) } "],

["combinedcompanydata.html", "5 Combined Company Data 5.1 Combined Company Stock Visualization 5.2 Combined Company Twitter Visualization", " 5 Combined Company Data 5.1 Combined Company Stock Visualization After collecting the stock price data from the companies, we combined them into two plots, following the same method as our Twitter visualization above. The first plot represents the stock prices for the companies compared against each other, while the second plot signifies the rate of change amongst the companies in terms of their stock price. Both of the plots are fairly linear and show consistently steady movement. This overall trend displays each company’s stock as being relatively stable. ggplot( companystock, aes(x = StockDate,y= Price)) + geom_line(aes( color= Company), lty = 1, size = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, color=&quot;#333333&quot;) + theme(legend.title=element_blank())+ labs(title=&quot;Combined Company Stock Data&quot;, x= &quot;Date&quot;, y= &quot;Price of Stock ($)&quot;) ggplot( companystock, aes(x = StockDate,y= scale(Price))) + geom_line(aes( color= Company), lty = 1, size = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, color=&quot;#333333&quot;) + theme(legend.title=element_blank())+ labs(title=&quot;Combined Company Stock Data&quot;, x= &quot;Date&quot;, y= &quot;Rate of Change&quot;) 5.2 Combined Company Twitter Visualization After we extracted the Twitter data from the four companies, we combined the data into two different plots. The first plot shows companies compared against one another based on the number of tweets per day. After that, we scaled the data to represent the rate of change against each other in the second plot. The results of both plots show an interesting relationship: the two plots look almost identical despite the second plot being based on the rate of change. This shows that even though Amazon had a significantly higher amount of tweets per day, they also experienced a significant rate of change during our twitter collection period. ggplot(new_all_data, aes(x = New_Date,y= Company_Date)) + geom_line(aes( color= CompanyName), lty = 1, size = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, color=&quot;#333333&quot;) + xlim(x= c(Sys.Date()-23, NA))+ theme(legend.title=element_blank())+ labs(title=&quot;Combined Company Twitter Data&quot;, x=&quot;Date&quot;, y=&quot;Number of Tweets&quot;) ggplot(new_all_data, aes(x = New_Date,y= scale(Company_Date))) + geom_line(aes( color= CompanyName), lty = 1, size = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, color=&quot;#333333&quot;) + xlim(x= c(Sys.Date()-23, NA))+ theme(legend.title=element_blank())+ labs(title=&quot;Combined Company Twitter Data&quot;, x=&quot;Date&quot;, y=&quot;Rate of Change&quot;) 5.2.1 Information Worth Noting The only real section of volatility is shown towards the end of the second plot with the Amazon trend. Towards the end of the term, we collected data for you to see a small dip. This makes sense considering the drastic change we saw in the tweet data for Amazon, but still doesn’t match the trend entirely. While there is no full explanation of Amazon’s trends not completely matching up, there have been previous accusations of “FC Ambassadors” putting up positive experiences about Amazon on social media. This amount of production these ambassadors cause has been criticized and possibly even reduced as of lately, explaining possible declines in Twitter activity. Further details can be accessed through the following article, “Amazon Uses Twitter Army of Employees to Fight Criticism of Warehouses”, by the New York Times (Jonah Bromwich, 2019). "],

While there are areas of difference, the general trend in regards to the rate of change is visibly similar. The stock price didn’t vary by more than $12 during our period of collection and the Twitter data was fairly stable with only a few instances of steep drops or rises. This leads us to believe that our hypothesis is supported through the analysis of Dell’s Twitter and stock price data. "],

The price of the stock never varied by more than $15 and the Twitter data was visibly steady for the middle two weeks of the data collection. The only visible volatility is shown at the beginning and end of the Twitter data plot. Even though there existed individual days of variance, the last plot which compares the Twitter and stock data, based on the rate of change, shows a direct similarity. Seen are the same peaks and dips between the two datasets, in turn supporting our hypothesis. "],

The price of the company’s stock doesn’t vary by more than $1.50 and the number of tweets doesn’t vary by more than 10 tweets. While the amount of engagement on Cisco’s Twitter handle was limited, the data we extracted and analyzed still shows a trend that supports our hypothesis. There are points on the third plot where the Twitter and stock data overlap completely, which suggests the relationship between the two is near perfect. The third plot also shows visual consistency through its plotted peaks and dips, displaying the ideal twitter and stock relationship trend with regards to whether company data supports our hypothesis.

When looking at the comparison plot of the two, the rate of change is almost exactly the same in some instances with little difference throughout the three weeks we collected data. If you look at the Twitter plot, you can see a steep drop towards the end of our collection period. While this drop aligns with the stock price, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why there’s an abrupt drop in Twitter engagement on their support Twitter handle. This drop is even more noticeable when looking at the Twitter data of all three companies measured in terms of rate of change. A reasonable and quite possible assumption for this significant drop could be due to the work of “FC Ambassadors”. These Amazon employees are tasked with patrolling Amazon’s Twitter handles at all times. There has been criticism regarding Amazon’s role in their social media presence, which could be a reason why we see the data drop. The Twitter engagement we saw for Amazon towards the end of the collection period was very similar to Dell and Microsoft, which leads us to believe that the numbers are more representative of an authentic customer satisfaction rate compared to the numbers at the beginning of the collection period.

["final-conclusion.html", "10 Final Conclusion", " 10 Final Conclusion Through a calculated analysis, we believe overwhelming evidence supports our hypothesis that there is a distinct inverse relationship between a company’s Twitter support page engagement and their respective stock price. While customer satisfaction through channels such as Twitter cannot faultlessly determine company success, it has shown itself to be a well-grounded indicator of stock performance. Twitter engagement data considers the success of products and services offered by companies through customer satisfaction in tweets. It also measures each company’s ability to holistically deliver a positive experience to its customers. The preponderance of the evidence stands to support our initial hypothesis. In sum, this further solidifies the presupposition that when companies successfully prioritize the customer experience, they will achieve a heightened level of success. "],
